# Visualizing results

While tables are useful for looking up information or finding specific numbers, it's usually easier to see trends and make sense of data using charts.

In Metabase, an answer to a question can be visualized in a number of ways:

- [Numbers](visualizations/numbers.md)
- [Trend](visualizations/trend.md)
- [Progress bar](visualizations/progress-bar.md)
- [Gauge](visualizations/gauge.md)
- [Table](visualizations/table.md)
- [Pivot table](visualizations/pivot-table.md)
- [Line chart](visualizations/line-bar-and-area-charts.md)
- [Bar chart](visualizations/line-bar-and-area-charts.md)
- [Combo chart](visualizations/combo-chart.md)
- [Waterfall chart](visualizations/waterfall-chart.md)
- [Row chart](visualizations/line-bar-and-area-charts.md)
- [Area chart](visualizations/line-bar-and-area-charts.md)
- [Scatterplot or bubble chart](visualizations/scatterplot-or-bubble-chart.md)
- [Pie/donut chart](visualizations/pie-or-donut-chart.md)
- [Funnel](visualizations/funnel.md)
- [Map](visualizations/map.md)

To change how the answer to your question is displayed, click on the **Visualization** button in the bottom-left of the screen to open the visualization sidebar.

If a particular visualization doesnâ€™t really make sense for your answer, that option will appear grayed out in the sidebar. You can still select a grayed-out option, though you might need to open the chart options to make your selection work with your data.

Once a question returns results, you can save the question, download the results, or add the question to a [dashboard](07-dashboards.md).

## Visualization types and options

Each visualization type has its own advanced options. Click the **Settings** button next to the Visualization button to see your options. The options panel also automatically opens up whenever you pick a new visualization type.
